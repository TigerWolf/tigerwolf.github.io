Hey Everyone,

Haven&#8217;t kept you all updated on what I&#8217;ve been doing so here&#8217;s a quick update. I&#8217;m currently typing this on my phone as the Internet here is so bad that the phone Internet is actually better! My flatmates and I have ordered telus which should be good when it gets here.

I&#8217;ve been extremely busy with things and been having such a great time that&#8217;s it&#8217;s been hard to force myself to sit in front of a computer when there are so many amazing things to do. At some stage I will be able to go through all my notes and write up all the stories between now and my last post, hopefully that isn&#8217;t if I get injured and don&#8217;t have anything else to do, lol.

Every day if I&#8217;m not working I&#8217;ll wake up at 7 and then head down the staff hill to catch the first gondola in the morning. I&#8217;ll be snowboarding all day till 3 and then trek back up the staff hill (it&#8217;s about 500m of constant incline, I call it gym hill as it&#8217;s a workout. There is a bus that goes up but it costs $2 and I really enjoy the excercise.)

I don&#8217;t have a constant roster yet but I&#8217;m working at rendevouz restuarant on blackcomb mountain, which opens on Thursday.

Well I gotta get some sleep now as it&#8217;s 3am. Stay tuned for more updates.
