I really enjoy computer games, its my main form of entertainment in the evening and a great stress reliever. I get so much enjoyment out of it that I was inspired to write a short story from my perspective and I thought would share it with you. This is from Guild Wars 2 (some references are very game specific).

> I said my goodbyes the Militia on TeamSpeak and dropped my WvW Commander Tag, just after having defeated a Sanctum of Rall zerg.
> 
> What a good night, I thought.
> 
> A few weeks ago I got excited about some changes to WvW that I had missed and wanted to check them out. I had been enjoying the new Living Story content but wanted to do something a little different. I jumped into World vs World and the first thing I noticed was that on the Borderlands the lake is gone! This looked like a big change, but on further inspection its quite simple. Now in the middle of the map is a set of capture points that allow a server to get the upper hand if they capture 3 of the 5 points. I was told on TeamSpeak that this was to replace the old orb system.

> I have been venturing onto BlackGate TeamSpeak server recently and its not as scary as I thought. I joined the channel for the borderland map I was on and I was pleasantly surprised by the commander which was on this same map. His name was Cuddlepie and had a good manner, running alongside him we ventured into enemy territory. We faced a big zerg almost twice our size that I thought we woudlnt be able to take on. Cuddlepie kept his cool and issued commands, like &#8220;head to the left then split them in half&#8221;, &#8220;take it to their backlines&#8221;. With his focus and strategy we where able to take down the entire zerg. What a rush!

> We continued on and took several towers and keeps. I had a really good night. Later in the week I joined again and where greeted by another commander from a guild called KING and he had a different game plan. We defended garrison from several attacks and got lots of badges. There feels like they is always some action and some really good commanders that I feel like our strong ties with BlackGate WvW community are such an untapped resource.

> Tonight, I jumped in and we where getting smashed by Jade Quarry. The commander tonight was Stellioz. I noticed the he has a philippines accent (I didnt know for a long while) and got really excited about WvW and showed some great skill in open field battles. The night continued on and I really enjoyed by time. He had to grab some dinner and we where left without a commander. I decided that I would give it a go, even though I didnt feel completely confident that I knew all of the current intel in WvW, I did it anyway as there where 5 Resonance online and in BlackGate TS so I thought &#8220;Why not?&#8221;. We where outnumbered and we took a few camps. We tried some things like some ninja trebs but the scouts where on to our plan. Later we defended our Tower several times against both Sancum and Jade. We responded to a Treb and took it out and saved our tower! Just as we saved our tower from an invading group we spotted a zerg bigger than ours. 
> 
> We didnt have many numbers at this time in the night and I wasnt sure we where able to take them on. We tracked them to a chocked point. Then we engaged them once and they rallied behind the tower. Just as things go quiet, Stellioz came back from dinner and jumped in too. We spotted another group, this time bigger than the last! Stellioz said we could take them and offered some comments on how we would engage them.
> 
> We where off!
> 
> Running right into the thick of the battle, dropping some fire for might and blasting it on our way through. We focused the back lines and taking out the elles and the necros. A few of us dropped and our warriors threw down banners getting our downed up. It finally looked like we would win! We cleaned up the rest some backing and frowing and we took out the zerg.

> The end.
