It was interesting to find out how they confirmed that MH370 crashed over the indian ocean.

The planes navigation system was communicating to a satellite even though the main transponder was turned off and it communicated every hour. The Satcom &#8220;which collects information such as location, altitude, heading and speed, and sends it through Inmarsatâ€™s satellites into their network&#8221;. The signal didnt contain any gps or location data so the analysts used techniques never used before, using the doppler effect (which describes how a wave changes frequency relative to the movement of an observer) and mathematical analysis so they could work out where the plane last was before it crashed. It was suspected the plane was above 30,000ft before it crashed.

The challenge now will be finding the black box before the battery runs out for the device in the black box that &#8220;pings&#8221; its location. If they do find it then the challenge of recovering it from such great depths in sea that has strong currents and dangerous weather.
