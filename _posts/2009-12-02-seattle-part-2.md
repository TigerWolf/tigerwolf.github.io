*Finally had some time to get my notes and write up about some of my past adventures, more to come!*

The next day I took the bus into Seattle after figuring it out. Its been a lot harder navigating around here without having internet on my phone as Ive become used to in Australia. Finding my way around Melbourne was easy as I could always pull up a bus timetable or web page about a place I wanted to visit. It was a long trip over the river on the bus but there where some amazing sights and seeing the Seattle skyline was great.

I didnt know where to get off so I got off the biggest station (University St) and started walking around on a quest I would find a shopping area or something interesting. I had a great walk, starting in a rich area with lots of high rise buildings and slowly noticing the places get smaller as I headed towards the coast, where I spotted a soup kitchen. Then I headed sideways up the kill into a China town area and then managed to get back to a different rich area where I could see lots of fancy hotels and fancy shops of big brands id heard of before. I found a monorail and walked along side of it and found my way to the Space Needle!

The space needle was a great, it wasnt very busy. I didnt go up as I didnt see much point.  Right below the space needle there is a science fiction museum and  a music exploration museum focusing on jimmy hendrix. They where both very cool.

The money in america is wierd, $1 notes are crazy and they are just on crappy paper. Also getting used to tips is wierd for me too.

When I was in seattle I also checked out a few shops, the prices in america are awesome but Im saving all of my money up for Whistler. I bought my snowboard in Seattle at snowboard connection. They where heaps friendly and I got an awesome deal, and offered me a beer too! I was there for ages getting the perfect setup. I now have a K2 Darkside (Snowboard), Ride bindings and some sweet K2 boots that are so counfy. Some pics will be up later.

Seattle was awesome and Ill have to go back there some time. Thanks K T for giving me a place to crash and for the awesome ride up to Whistler.

Stay tuned for the next update! VANCOUVER!
