Wow! Just had the most amazing surprise party pulled on me.

If you didnt know, im heading to Canada on a working holiday for 7 months with a little bit of travel at the start and end to see USA. I have a job as a food station server at the Whistler Blackcomb ski resort in the state of British Columbia.

Without me knowing, my girlfriend Elysia organised a suprise going away party for me! I thought I was going over to join the family for a Sunday dinner when I was greeted by a huge crowd all yelling suprise! I was so shocked I had no idea what to say or do.

It was great to see all of my friends that turned up to wish me well and a few faces I hadn&#8217;t seen in a while. Thanks for coming everyone! There where so many people to chat to and I had a fantastic time.

Not long till I leave now (25th of October). I&#8217;ll be posting more updates as the holiday continues.

That&#8217;s it for now, Kieran
